    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>From my perspective, progressive enhancement is simply a web development approach focused on delivering the meat of the product -- the content -- to the audience first and foremost.  Then, when the foundation has been established, the outer coatings -- the presentation through CSS and the behavior capabilities through JavaScript -- could be added around the content to supplement it.  In this case, CSS and JavaScript are the supporting cast members to HTML.  You can strip away the added presentation and behavior elements, and the content of the website will still be able to stand on its own and stay functional to offer a basic web experience.</p>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is very important in modern web development for many reasons.  Practicing progressive enhancement emphasizes the content as the most important element of web development.  This avoids making presentation and dynamic behavioral features at the top of the priority list, which if they were, would increase the working cost and overhead of the website.  Making content the core of the website is the cheapest way to create and maintain a website.  Also, practicing progressive enhancement allows for the highest compatibility with many older browsers.  In the case of graceful degradation, it emphasizes utilization of the most advanced and capable browsers that allows the most presentation and behavioral features to make the website looking as fancy and sophisticated as possible.  This approach limits many low-powered computers' ability to handle these extra features.</p>
    <p>Another article I found on progressive enhancement is called <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/" target="_blank">What is Progressive Enhancement, and Why It Matters</a> from freeCodeCamp.  The article states 3 important and familiar features previously discussed which makes the approach stand out:   strong foundation, stability, and accessibility.  Using this approach allows for web development that keeps the basic functionalities of a website alive when the worst-case scenario happens.  All-inclusivity regarding end-users reigns supreme.</p>
