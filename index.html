    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>From my perspective, progressive enhancement is simply a web development approach focused on delivering the meat of the product -- the content -- to the audience first and foremost.  Then, when the foundation has been established, the outer coatings -- the presentation through CSS and the behavior capabilities through JavaScript -- could be added around the content to supplement it.  In this case, CSS and JavaScript are the supporting cast members to HTML.  You can strip away the added presentation and behavior elements, and the content of the website will still be able to stand on its own and stay functional to offer a basic web experience.</p>

    <p>Progressive enhancement is very important in modern web development for many reasons.  Practicing progressive enhancement emphasizes the content as the most important element of web development.  This avoids making presentation and dynamic behavioral features at the top of the priority list, which if they were, would increase the working cost and overhead of the website.  Making content the core of the website is the cheapest way to create and maintain a website.  Also, practicing progressive enhancement allows for the highest compatibility with many older browsers.  In the case of graceful degradation, it emphasizes utilization of the most advanced and capable browsers that allows the most presentation and behavioral features to make the website looking as fancy and sophisticated as possible.  This approach limits many low-powered computers' ability to handle these extra features.</p>

    <p>Another article I found on progressive enhancement is called <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/" target="_blank">What is Progressive Enhancement, and Why It Matters</a> from freeCodeCamp.  The article states 3 important and familiar features previously discussed which makes the approach stand out:   strong foundation, stability, and accessibility.  Using this approach allows for web development that keeps the basic functionalities of a website alive when the worst-case scenario happens.  All-inclusivity regarding end-users reigns supreme.</p>

    <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>I have asked my friend Aidan to critique my 2nd draft of the SpaceX Dragon project (the reason why I sent Aidan my 2nd draft was because my 1st draft was just laying out the HTML structure and content of the project, whereas my 2nd draft implemented some CSS).  Initially, my color scheme consisted of blue, yellow, and white, which are the main colors used in the Blue Origin website.  I thought it looked catchy and clean, but my friend suggested that I use dark colors like ones used in the SpaceX website.  His reasoning was that his color scheme would look more space-like and sleeker than my color scheme.  Another suggestion he had was adding an image slideshow of SpaceX Dragon on the homepage.  His thought process was that the homepage's main purpose was to pull in viewers and get their attention.  Also, he wanted to see more CSS transitions for my clickable links.</p>

    <p>My learning experience on working with this SpaceX Dragon project has been great and fulfilling.  This project allowed me to gauge where I was at in terms of my mastery of the material taught in class.  I have unfortunately learned that my mastery level of the material was novice at best.  I am aware that I was not expected to technically master all the CSS tricks and tools mentioned in class, but I believe that everything that was taught in class would be essential in building a good website with good functionality.  During the project, there was a lot of trial-and-error moments, which I believe is normal for these types of projects and assignments overall.  You won't learn anything unless you try things on your own and stuff that is unfamiliar to you.  I appreciate these types of assignments/projects because it allows for so much experimentation that should be very both informative and enjoyable.  At least to me it was.  The one thing I wish I did was to look at some more CSS and JavaScript tricks to make my project fancy.</p>

    <p>My experience with this class during the semester was what I expected and more.  I expected to learn the basis of what web development is and to learn the essential tools (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to make a functional website.  What I got was that and a lot of tips on not just making a website, but also on making a good website that could cater to the intended audience.  You (Professor Wallace) have made this class so enjoyable and educational.  Your mastery and experience in the material clearly shows through your lectures, and I very much appreciate that.  Even though I was not able to attend most of the classes, I am glad I was able to watch the recordings.  One thing I did well in was learning how certain HTML and CSS features work and applying them in different situations.  If I had to start the class over, I would have spent more time learning all the different CSS features.  </p>

    <p>In the end, I decided to implement most of what Aidan suggested.  Even though the changes may not mean much, since only you will see my final project, this shows that I am willing to take in constructive criticism and implement changes when necessary.</p>
